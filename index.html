         <p>I love soccer because I can run and kick soccer balls. Another reason why I love soccer is because the feeling of scoring a goal and knowing that you helped your team win is so exciting.</p>

  <h2>What position do I play?</h2>
I play a midfielder on the soccer field. When your a midfielder you pretty much have to protect the center of the field. Now this doesn't mean you just stand in the middle the whole time. As a midfielder you protect the center the field while running back and forward up the field.

<h2>Why do I like to play soccer?</h2> 

<ul>
    <li>I like to play soccer because I have the opportunity to run around</li>
    <li>Kick soccer balls all across the field</li>
     <li>Assist on awesome goals</li>
          <li>I can score awesome goals</li>
          
     </ul>
